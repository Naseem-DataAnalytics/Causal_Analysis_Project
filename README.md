# 📦 Causal Impact Analysis of a Sales Promotion

This R project analyzes the causal impact of a simulated free shipping promotion on e-commerce sales using the Olist dataset from Brazil. The goal was to estimate the promotion’s effectiveness, test its robustness, and translate findings into actionable business recommendations.

---
## 📌 Executive Summary

* **What happened**: The free shipping promotion increased sales overall, but the impact was not uniform across categories.
* **So what**: Blanket promotions are inefficient; targeted promotions maximize ROI.
* **Key result**: The `health_beauty` category saw an **82.6% lift**, equal to **R$69** in additional daily profit.
* **What’s next**: Pilot targeted promotions in top-performing categories and validate with a controlled A/B test.

## 📊 Key Results

### 1. Sales Trends Before & After Promotion

![Sales Trends Plot](outputs/sales_trends.png)
*Dashed line = promotion start. The treatment state (SP) diverges from control states post-promotion, consistent with a causal effect.*

### 2. Category-Level Promotion Effects

*The promotion’s effect varies widely by category. `health_beauty` shows a strong, statistically significant lift, while others remain neutral or even negative.*

## 🔧 Methods & Tools
* **Data Wrangling**: `tidyverse`, `lubridate`
* **Modeling**: Two-Way Fixed Effects Regression (`fixest::feols`)
* **Validation**: Placebo Test for robustness
* **Visualization**: `ggplot2`
* **Reporting**: R Markdown
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
* **Recommendation**: Focus promotions on high-response categories (`health_beauty`, `bed_bath_table`) instead of blanket campaigns.
* **Business Impact**: Estimated **R$69** in daily incremental profit from `health_beauty` alone.
* **Future Analysis**: Investigate why these categories respond better (margins, repeat customers, product type).
* **Next Step**: Confirm findings with a formal A/B test to reduce risk of seasonal bias.

---
## ⚠️ Limitations & Assumptions
* **Placebo Test**: A false positive effect (14.8%) appeared when shifting the promotion date earlier, suggesting seasonality may confound results.
* **Model Assumptions**: Difference-in-differences relies on parallel trends; future work could test advanced time-series or causal impact models.

## 🎓 Learning Reflection
This project helped me practice:
* Building and cleaning relational datasets with attention to data quality assurance.
* Applying causal inference methods (Difference-in-Differences, Placebo Test).
* Communicating technical findings through business-ready insights and visualizations.

I also recognized key limitations (seasonality, model assumptions) and proposed improvements (A/B testing). I look forward to further developing these skills during the Google Data Analytics Apprenticeship.
